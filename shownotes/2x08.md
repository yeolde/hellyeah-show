### Games Update

#### Skyrim is dumb
* I'm playing it, but I don't like it.
	* Bad combat
	* Bad lore
	* Dull story
* Also, how many urns must I open?

#### Diablo III is awesome 
* This is a very fun game.
* Still liking Witchdoctor but Barbarian is great too.
	* Naming a Barbarian is hard work.

#### MOP Beta
* I like it.  Big changes for Warlocks and Shaman, so I'm pretty intrigued.

### Document Scanners
* I looked high and low for a document scanner
	* DEVONthink Filing
	* Hazel rules for sorting
